The official implementation of the paper "[AgentDyn: A Dynamic Open-Ended Benchmark for Evaluating Prompt Injection Attacks of Real-World Agent Security System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03117)".

AgentDyn is a dynamic, open-ended agent security benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended user tasks and 560 injection test cases across the Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life scenarios. It is built on top of the [AgentDojo](https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo) framework. A huge thanks to the AgentDojo team for their admirable contribution to the community!

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e .
```


## Running the benchmark

For adaptability, we support an evaluation script same as AgentDojo's. Documentation on how to use the script can be obtained with the `--help` flag.

For example, to run the `shopping` suite , with `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` as the LLM, the tool filter as a defense, and the attack with important_instructions, run the following command:

```bash
python -m agentdojo.scripts.benchmark -s shopping \
    --model GPT_4O_2024_08_06 \
    --defense tool_filter --attack important_instructions
```

Before running, please export your API key, through:

1. OpenAI Model: export OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
2. Google Model: export GOOGLE_API_KEY=XXX
3. Open-sourced Models (Qwen, LlaMA): export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=XXX

## Supported settings

#### Avaliable Suites:
AgentDyn supports `shopping`,`github`, and `dailylife` suites, as well as the original four suites from AgentDojo (`banking`,`slack`, `travel` and `workspace`).

#### Avaliable Models: 
We evaluate the following models in our paper: ``GPT_4O_MINI_2024_07_18``, ``GPT_4O_2024_08_06``, ``GEMINI_2_5_FLASH``, ``GEMINI_2_5_PRO``, ``LLAMA_3_3_70B``, ``QWEN3_235B``, ``GPT_5_1_2025_11_13``, ``GPT_5_MINI_2025_08_07``. 
Other models supported by AgentDojo are also compatible.

#### Avaliable Defenses: 
In addition to the original defenses in AgentDojo, we provide support for [PIGuard](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1468.pdf) and [PromptGuard2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Prompt-Guard-2-86M). The complete list of defenses supported in our paper includes: ``repeat_user_prompt``, ``spotlighting_with_delimiting``, ``tool_filter``, ``transformers_pi_detector``, ``piguard_detector``, ``prompt_guard_2_detector``.
